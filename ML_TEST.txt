Problem 1:
This task is to build a predictive model which is able to distinguish 0 or 1 based on an input value.
"training-data-small.txt.bz2" file contains training dataset that consists of output/input pairs (tab-separated).
By using the constructed model, generate predictions for each line in "test-data-small.txt.bz2" file containing test dataset.
Submit your predictions and a report explaining the process for making the model.

Problem 2:
The task is similar with the exception of the dataset (note: the dataset is significantly larger than the earlier one).
Training dataset is in "training-data-large.txt.bz2", and test dataset is in "test-data-large.txt.bz2".
